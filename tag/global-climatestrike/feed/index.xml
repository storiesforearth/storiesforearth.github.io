<p>On Friday, September 20th, we will be joining thousands of other websites in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Digital #ClimateStrike (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net/" target="_blank">Digital #ClimateStrike</a>. This is part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Global #ClimateStrike (opens in a new tab)" href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/" target="_blank">Global #ClimateStrike</a>, a one-day strike led by young people from around the world to demand an end to the era of fossil fuels.</p>



<p>The Digital #ClimateStrike is a way for people to show their support for the Global #ClimateStrike by effectively shutting down their websites for the day. People can also use a closable overlay option if they aren&#8217;t able to totally shut down their websites. The Digital #ClimateStrike will last all day on September 20th with the intention of disrupting business as usual.</p>



<p>Burning fossil fuels is warming our world to deadly—and potentially apocalyptic—levels. Even if the countries committed to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Paris Agreement (opens in a new tab)" href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank">The Paris Agreement</a> succeed in preventing average global temperatures from rising above 2ºC, we will see major refugee crises, water shortages, crop failures, extreme political and economic instability, and, of course, devastating storms and wildfires like Hurricane Dorian and the California Camp Fire. To mitigate widespread death and suffering from the human-caused <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="sixth mass extinction (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn" target="_blank">sixth mass extinction</a> we&#8217;re witnessing, humanity absolutely must stop using fossil fuels as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Stories for Earth stands with climate strikers from all over our unlikely and precious planet, and we are joined by other organizations including the Sunrise Movement, WordPress, Tumblr, Imgur, Greenpeace, BitTorrent, and Kickstarter, to name a few. We hope you&#8217;ll join us in peacefully protesting against the destruction of our home. Click the banner below to learn more and to download graphics for spreading the word.</p>
