<p>Hope. It&#8217;s in short supply these days, particularly among those of us who are climate-aware.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the IPCC released a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05042022/ipcc-report-climate-change/" target="_blank">new report</a> warning it&#8217;s &#8220;now or never&#8221; to act on climate change if we&#8217;re to limit global warming to 2.7ºF (1.5ºC). President Biden recently announced plans to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-plan-aid-europe-with-lng-poses-risk-us-climate-goals-2022-04-14/" target="_blank">increase exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG)</a> to make Europe less dependent on Russian fuel in addition to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/04/15/nation/biden-plans-open-more-public-land-drilling-2/" target="_blank">resuming the selling of oil and gas drilling leases</a> on public land—two major mistakes that spell bad news for the climate and therefore all life on Earth. There&#8217;s more, of course, but you don&#8217;t need me to tell you.</p>



<p>And yet, some people have the audacity to talk about hope. Who are these people? Two voices I&#8217;ve been paying attention to lately are Dr. Jane Goodall and Dr. Viktor Frankl. In her latest book, <em>The Book of Hope: A Survival Guide for Trying Times</em>, Dr. Goodall says, &#8220;Hope…is what enables us to keep going in the face of adversity. It is what we desire to happen, but we must be prepared to work hard to make it so.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dr. Viktor Frankl was an Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, and Holocaust survivor who wrote in his book <em>Man&#8217;s Search for Meaning</em>, &#8220;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.&#8221; Dr. Frankl was also fond of quoting Nietzsche, who said, &#8220;He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.&#8221;</p>



<p>I struggle with hope. I guess all thoughtful people tuned in to what&#8217;s going on in the world do. Sometimes I try not to think about hope, preferring to keep my head down doing what work I can to help. Other times I do genuinely feel hopeful, like when I read about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/looking-join-green-economy-here-fastest-growing-us-jobs-george-anders/" target="_blank">growth of green jobs</a>, Germany shortening its timeline to 100% renewable energy by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://grist.org/beacon/germanys-plan-to-drop-russian-gas/" target="_blank">15 years</a>, and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/technology/amazon-union-staten-island.html" target="_blank">exciting vote to unionize</a> at the Amazon facility on Staten Island.</p>



<p>News in the real world isn&#8217;t a reliable source of the warm-and-fuzzies, but it has its moments. And then there&#8217;s fiction.</p>



<p>I recently had the pleasure of interviewing author G.G. Kellner about her debut novel, <em>Hope, A History of the Future</em>. With this, Kellner has done the difficult work of imaging a hopeful future. It&#8217;s not a sunshine-and-rainbows kind of future—some very bad things still happen—but it is decidedly hopeful.</p>



<p>Living in the world we live in, I think just writing this book in the first place was an act of radical hope. We hear a lot about how screwed we are, but it&#8217;s rare to be offered a vision of what a better world might look like. This book is inspiring, and it&#8217;s a call to action to bring forth this better world. I would love to see more artists channeling their imaginations in this direction, so I&#8217;m thrilled to share my and Kellner&#8217;s conversation about her novel.</p>



<p>At the risk of sounding preachy—don&#8217;t give up hope. Find your &#8220;why,&#8221; and let the hard work of building a better world give you purpose. There is still so much good in the world worth fighting for.</p>
